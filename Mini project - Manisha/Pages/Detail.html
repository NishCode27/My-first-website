		country is relatively small in size, it has the highest biodiversity density in Asia. Remarkably high proportion
		of the species among its flora and fauna, 27% of the 3,210 flowering plants and 22% of the mammals, are endemic.
		Sri Lanka has declared 24 wildlife reserves, which are home to a wide range of native species such as Asian
		elephants, leopards, sloth bears, the unique small lories, a variety of deer, the purple-faced langur, the
		endangered wild boar, porcupines and anteaters. Among the trees of the dry-land forests are valuable species
		such as satinwood, ebony, ironwood, mahogany and teak. These are the famous National Parks in Sri Lanka – Yala,
		Wilpaththu, Sinharaja, Udawalawa and Kumana Bird Sanctuary.</p>
